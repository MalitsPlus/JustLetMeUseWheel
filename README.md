# JustLetMeUseWheel

Simply mapping all `Wheel Scrolls Down` events to `Left Click`.

## Why

Most of the old generation [Eroge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroge)s don't support scrolling wheel down to proceed messages resulting thousands of users have to lift their fingers onto the click board and painfully push it down again and again which imho can be considered a **totally disregard of humanity** that is never forgivable even if the game was born before the scroll-wheel mouses have come to their trend.

Let's shout this loudly out: **NO WHEEL NO GAME**!

## How to use

Run `run.ps1`.  
You may need to install python 3.10 (other versions perhaps are also available, not tested though) first if you didn't.
